# Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This is my project for the Etch-a-Sketch assignment on The Odin Project. An Etch-A-Sketch is a toy for making drawings which are created by turning two knobs. In this version, you create art by hovering over squares on a grid to colour them in. You can change colours to add more style to your drawing and if you want, you cna enable rainbow mode to give each square a random colour. If you need more squares, you may resize the grid from 1 x 1 to 64 x 64.
