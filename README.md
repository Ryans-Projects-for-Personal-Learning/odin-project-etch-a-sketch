# Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This is my project for the Etch-a-Sketch assignment on The Odin Project. An Etch-A-Sketch is a toy for making drawings which are created by turning two knobs. In this version, you create art by hovering over squares on a grid to colour them in. You can change colours to add more style to your drawing and if you want, you can enable rainbow mode to give each square a random colour. If you need more squares, you may resize the grid from 1 x 1 to 64 x 64. 

Note: This application has not been optimized for mobile nor did it have to be as it wasjust concerned with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is best suited for a 1920 x 1080 screen and you may get less than optimal results with much smaller screens.
